Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look"</p>                                    <img src="img/chair1.png" alt="side view pf chair">                                    <p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York</p>                                    <p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way:    Does it interest and intrigue us?

As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".</p>                                                <p>A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place".
